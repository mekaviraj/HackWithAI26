# Student Performance Analyzer MVP

A comprehensive web application designed to analyze student performance data using machine learning principles. The MVP includes 5 key stages of analysis.

## 📊 MVP Features (5 Stages)

### 1. **Collect Student Performance Data**

- Upload student test scores via CSV files
- Support for multiple subjects and students
- Real-time file validation

### 2. **Analyze & Detect Weaknesses**

- Statistical analysis of subject-wise performance
- Identification of weak areas (scores below 60%)
- Student failure count per subject

### 3. **Rank Weak Areas**

- Severity-based ranking system
- Identification of priority subjects
- Performance distribution analysis (Q1, Q3, median)

### 4. **Generate 7-Day Problem-Focused Plan**

- Automated study schedule targeting weak areas
- Daily goals and activities
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Revision on Day 7

### 5. **Recommend Free Study Material**

- Subject-specific free resources
- Links to Khan Academy, Brilliant, OpenStax, etc.
- Study tips for each subject

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Flask (Web Framework)
- Pandas (Data Analysis)
- NumPy (Numerical Computing)

**Frontend:**

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Responsive Design)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Chart.js (Data Visualization)

```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Flask Application

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:5000`

## 📝 CSV File Format

Your input CSV should have this structure:

```
name,Math,Physics,Chemistry,English,History
John Doe,75,80,85,90,88
Jane Smith,65,70,75,80,82
Bob Johnson,55,60,65,78,85
```

**Requirements:**

- First column: Student names (header: `name` or `student_id`)
- Remaining columns: Subject scores (0-100)
- No header row should be blank
- Scores should be numeric values

## 🎯 How It Works

### Stage 1: Data Collection

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Upload a CSV file with student performance data
3. Alternative: Click "View Sample Analysis" to see demo data

### Stage 2: Analysis

The analyzer calculates:

- Mean, median, standard deviation for each subject
- Quartile ranges (Q1, Q3)
- Min/max scores
- Failure count (scores < 40)

### Stage 3: Weakness Detection

- Identifies subjects with mean score < 60%
- Calculates severity score (100 - average_score)
- Counts students below 60% and 40% thresholds

### Stage 4: Planning

- Ranks weak areas by severity
- Creates a 7-day study schedule
- Focuses most on weakest areas (Days 1-2)
- Includes revision day (Day 7)

### Stage 5: Recommendations

- Suggests free online resources:
  - Khan Academy courses
  - Problem-solving platforms
  - Textbooks and tutorials
- Provides personalized study tips

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The analysis dashboard displays:

- **Statistics Cards**: Total students, average score, weak areas
- **Performance Chart**: Bar chart of subject-wise scores
- **Ranking Chart**: Line chart showing severity and performance trends
- **Detailed Analysis**: Subject statistics with quartile ranges
- **7-Day Plan**: Day-by-day study schedule with activities
- **Recommendations**: Free study materials for each weak area
- **Study Tips**: Subject-specific learning strategies

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Upload & Analyze

```
POST /api/upload
- Accepts: CSV file
- Returns: Comprehensive analysis with plan and recommendations
```

### Sample Data

```
GET /api/sample
- Returns: Pre-loaded sample analysis for demo
```

### Health Check

```
GET /api/health
- Returns: Service status
```

## 📈 Analysis Metrics

### Severity Scoring

```
Severity = 100 - Average Score
```

### Weakness Threshold

- Weak Area: Average Score < 60%
- Failing: Score < 40
- Needs Improvement: Score < 60

## 💾 Data Storage

Currently, data is processed in-memory during the session. For production:

- Implement database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Store student profiles
- Track progress over time
- Generate historical reports

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify 7-Day Plan

Edit `backend/planner.py`:

- Change focus distribution
- Add new activity types
- Adjust study time recommendations

### Add Study Resources

Edit `backend/recommendations.py`:

- Add more resource links
